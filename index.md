# **Projects**

## Nehan

This is my master's final project, which isn't finished yet. It's a platform and puzzles 3D game where the main character has three different time-related powers, including rewinding, slowing time down and creating a copy of himself to do a task and then replay what the clone copy did. 

The team is formed by more than fifteen people from different roles such as marketing, production, art, design and programmers, being myself in this last one discipline. As a student in videogame development I'm trying to learn as much as I can about every aspect of the development, such as gameplay, AI, computer graphics, technology and user interface. The game it's being developed using Unreal Engine 4.


## Repair URSS

This is a 2D top-down action videogame that some friends and I develop on the Global Game Jam 2019 in just two days using Unity. The code word for the Jam was "repair" and we came up with this fun twist for that concept. 

In this project my main focus was the gameplay, where I spent most of the duration of the Jam. In my opinion, the most interesting things about game is that, even though the size of the map is fixed, the layout of the different assets was generated randomly while loading the level using a custom algorithm for that. Provided the limited time, the game ended up pretty fun but unpolished, as it was expected. 

The game can be played [here](https://davymarquez.itch.io/repairurrs) and the repository with the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/ferdelmo/RepairURSS).

## Efficient Sampling of Elliptical Lights

This is my University final project, where I used the physically based [Mitsuba Renderer](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/) to implement an algorithm to efficiently sample the subtended solid angle of a elliptical light, allowing lower variance in the final result than previous work. In this project I had the chance to do my final University project within the [Graphics and Imaging Lab](https://graphics.unizar.es/) research group, surrounded by some of the best researchers in the area. It was a great experience and aroused my curiosity around Computer Graphics research.

Here are some renders using my algorithm.

## Non-real Time Renderer

This is a little non-real time renderer implemeted while at University using both path-tracing and photon-mapping techniques. Apart from implementing different geometries and materials, it also implements participating isotropic media. I really enjoyed this project and it helped me a lot in the understanding of 3D mathematics and physically-based image rendering.

## Devil Daggers

This is a project that two colleagues and I had to develop for a subject while at University. It is also the first videogame I ever took part in. It was developed using OpenGL and C++.

It is a cheap copy of the videogame developed by indie company Sorath, [Devil Daggers](https://devildaggers.com/). The game we developed had the alternative of either a 2D top-down shooter version or a 3D FPS version (just like the original game). I worked mainly on the gameplay and AI part of the game, while also using briefly the computer graphics API OpenGL. 

Here I upload two captures of both de 2D and 3D version of the game.
