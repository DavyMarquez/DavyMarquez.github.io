## Projects

## Nehan

This is my master's final project, which isn't finished yet. It's a platform and puzzles 3D game where the main character has three different time-related powers, including rewinding, slowing time down and creating a copy of himself to do a task and then replay what the clone copy did. 

The team is formed by more than fifteen people from different roles such as marketing, production, art, design and programmers, being myself in this last one discipline. As a student in videogame development I'm trying to learn as much as I can about every aspect of the development, such as gameplay, AI, computer graphics, technology and user interface. The game it's being developed using Unreal Engine 4.


## Repair URSS

This is a 2D top-down action videogame that some friends and I develop on the Global Game Jam 2019 in just two days using Unity. 

In this project my main focus was the gameplay, where I spent most of the duration of the Jam. In my opinion, the most interesting things about game is that, even though the size of the map is fixed, the layout of the different assets was generated randomly while loading the level using a custom algorithm for that. Provided the limited time, the game ended up pretty fun but unpolished, as it was expected. 

The game can be played here (PON UN PUTO LINK HIJODE PUTA)

## Devil Daggers

This is a project that two colleagues and I had to develop for a subject while at University. It is also the first videogame I ever took part in. It was developed using OpenGL and C++.

It is a cheap copy of the videogame developed by indie company Sorath, [Devil Daggers](https://devildaggers.com/). The game we developed had the alternative of either a 2D top-down shooter version or a 3D FPS version (just like the original game). I worked mainly on the gameplay and AI part of the game, while also using briefly the computer graphics API OpenGL. 

[Here](https://github.com/ferdelmo/videojuego) is the repository where all the source code is stored.

## Non-real Time Renderer

This is a little non-real time renderer implemeted while at University using both path-tracing and photon-mapping techniques. Apart from implementing different geometries and materials, it also implement participating isotropic media.
